`simulation.py` reads the in `simulation_parameters.csv` extracted stimulation parameter and creates SimNIBS simulations for the extracted data.
The mA column is ignored so that the extend of the current flow is visually comparable between the different values. The cathode positions in the `simulation_parameters.csv` is manually determined in the SimNIBS GUI.
