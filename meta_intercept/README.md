Meta-analysis of previous contextual learning studies to get a vague idea how the intercept of the bayesian model should be placed. Data by Kurmakaeva et al.(2021) had to be extracted by hand. Here, the concrete words value of the sham group at day 1 was extracted from **Figure 5** using coordinates in a grid. The values were used to compute the mean and the standard deviation via `kurmakaeva_points_to_data.R` and subsequently used in `meta_intercept.R`. The forest plot is also seen in `meta_intercept.png.`
